    fullBio: `Hi there! I'm a 17-year-old full-stack developer with an insatiable curiosity for technology and problem-solving. My journey into the world of programming started early, and I've been hooked ever since.

I specialize in building full-stack SaaS applications from scratch, with a deep focus on modern web technologies. My tech stack includes React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and various databases. I'm particularly passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and robust backend systems that scale.

Beyond web development, I'm diving deep into Computer Science fundamentals, exploring AI/ML concepts, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can build. I believe in learning by doing, which is why I've shipped multiple projects that solve real problems for real users.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading about emerging technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or brainstorming the next big idea. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my passion for innovation.

If you're working on something interesting or need a dedicated developer who brings fresh perspectives and relentless energy to your project, let's connect! I'm always up for a challenge and ready to turn ideas into reality.`,
